## Overview (required)

This guidance demonstrates how to build a scalable data pipeline that extracts operational data from SAP systems and loads it into Snowflake for analytics. Using AWS Glue as the ETL service, the solution automates the transformation and movement of data while maintaining security and performance. Organizations can leverage this integration to unlock business insights from their SAP data through Snowflake's high-performance analytics capabilities, enabling data-driven decision making across the enterprise.

### Cost ( required )

Core Infrastructure Components

AWS Glue (Data Processing)

Pricing: $0.44 per DPU-Hour, billed per second with 1-minute minimum
Estimated Usage: For daily ETL jobs processing SAP data
Assuming 2-hour daily job with 10 DPUs: 10 × 2 × $0.44 = $8.80/day
Monthly Cost: ~$264
Amazon S3 (Data Storage)

Raw Data Storage: $0.023 per GB/month for Standard storage
Estimated Usage:
Initial data load: 100GB-1TB
Daily incremental: 1-10GB
Monthly Cost: $50-300 (depending on data volume)
Snowflake Integration Costs

Data Transfer: Between AWS and Snowflake
Inter-region transfer: $0.02-0.09 per GB
Estimated monthly: $50-200
Snowflake Compute: Based on usage patterns
Standard edition: Base pricing
Enterprise/Business Critical: 1.5x-3x higher for enhanced security
Total Monthly Cost Estimate
