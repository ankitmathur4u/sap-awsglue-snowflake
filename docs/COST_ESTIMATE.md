SAP to Snowflake AWS Infrastructure Cost Estimate

A comprehensive cost breakdown for building the SAP to Snowflake solution (excluding SAP licensing costs):

Core Infrastructure Components

AWS Glue (Data Processing)
- Pricing: $0.44 per DPU-Hour, billed per second with 1-minute minimum 
- Estimated Usage: For daily ETL jobs processing SAP data
  - Assuming 2-hour daily job with 10 DPUs: 10 × 2 × $0.44 = $8.80/day
  - Monthly Cost: ~$264

 Amazon S3 (Data Storage)
- Raw Data Storage: $0.023 per GB/month for Standard storage 
- Estimated Usage: 
  - Initial data load: 100GB-1TB
  - Daily incremental: 1-10GB
  - Monthly Cost: $50-300 (depending on data volume)

 SAP S/4HANA Infrastructure (AWS)
Based on the CloudFormation template deployment:
- EC2 Instances: For S/4HANA fully activated appliance
  - Estimated cost: $500-2,000/month depending on instance size 
- EBS Storage: For SAP database and application storage
  - Estimated cost: $100-500/month

 Snowflake Integration Costs
- Data Transfer: Between AWS and Snowflake
  - Inter-region transfer: $0.02-0.09 per GB 
  - Estimated monthly: $50-200
- Snowflake Compute: Based on usage patterns 
  - Standard edition: Base pricing
  - Enterprise/Business Critical: 1.5x-3x higher for enhanced security

 Total Monthly Cost Estimate

 Small Implementation (Development/Testing)
- AWS Glue: $264
- S3 Storage: $50
- SAP Infrastructure: $500
- Data Transfer: $50
- Total: ~$864/month

 Medium Implementation (Production)
- AWS Glue: $500 (more frequent jobs)
- S3 Storage: $150
- SAP Infrastructure: $1,200
- Data Transfer: $100
- Snowflake Integration: $200
- Total: ~$2,150/month

 Large Implementation (Enterprise)
- AWS Glue: $1,000+ (multiple daily jobs, larger DPUs)
- S3 Storage: $300
- SAP Infrastructure: $2,000+
- Data Transfer: $200
- Additional AWS services (VPC, CloudWatch, etc.): $100
- Total: ~$3,600+/month

 Cost Optimization Recommendations

1. Use Reserved Instances: Can reduce EC2 costs by up to 86% 
2. Optimize Glue Jobs: Right-size DPUs and minimize runtime 
3. Implement Data Lifecycle Policies: Move older data to cheaper S3 storage classes
4. Monitor Data Transfer: Optimize cross-region transfers to minimize costs 

 Additional Considerations

- Snowflake Costs: Separate from AWS, based on compute credits and storage
- Network Costs: VPN/Direct Connect for secure connectivity 
- Monitoring & Management: CloudWatch, additional operational tools
- Backup & DR: Additional storage and compute for disaster recovery

The actual costs will vary significantly based on:
- Data volume and processing frequency
- SAP system size and complexity
- Snowflake usage patterns
- Regional pricing differences
- Specific security and compliance requirements
